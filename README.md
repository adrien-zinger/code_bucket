# Collection of some ideas

This repository is a container for professional or private work that are just experimental.

You can look at my blog where I speak about some of those mini projects [here](https://www.maybeuninit.com)

## Non blocking queue

Rust implementation of a non blocking queue based
on linked list. I had for goal to use this in a C
library. In c_redux for example.

## C Reagir

Implements a C library that give a simple framework
for the conception of states machine. There is a lot
of inspiration from Redux or React.
