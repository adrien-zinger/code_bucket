# Collection of code, little tools and ideas

You can look at my blog where I speak about some of those mini projects [here](https://www.maybeuninit.com)


non-blocking-queue: Rust implementation of a non blocking queue based
on linked list. Also a C implementation.

reagir: Implements a C library that give a simple framework
for the conception of states machine. There is a lot
of inspiration from Redux or React.

gpio\_sim: Little tool that simulate a gpio chip with one line. You can
command `set high` and `set low` to change the pin state.
